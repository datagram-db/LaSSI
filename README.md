LaSSI stands for `LogicAl, Semantic, and Structure text Interpretation`. This pipeline challenges the usual learning-based approaches by making the machine directly interpret the text through logical and verifiable steps in light of recent insights on Verified Artificial Intelligence. This project originated in 2020 for a web-crawling app that was later incorporated into a broader pipeline for textual data analysis.
